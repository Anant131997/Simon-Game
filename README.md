# Simon-Game
This is a unique and interesting game in which user has to remember all the colors blinked from level 0 to current level and have to tap the mouse over the buttons according the  blinking of color. If user presses any wrong button, game overs and level becomes zero. I have used HTML,CSS and JavaScript(embedded with jQuery library) to create this game.
